- Computing and Combine things -> Computed is better. (Modify something and them return, display something different.)

- Watch is good for trigger an side effect -> specific api call  when you reactive data has sit an certain State. for actions watch is perfect.


Example to why use computed properties instead of watchers

-  Data vizualization example -> If you try any SVG animation, will now that are a lot of pieces that are influent in the animation -> a lot happen : if you put an watcher in that
	- If you not careful -> you trigger re-renders when you no want.


- Computed properties have an tracker explicitly, so is better to performance automazation and caching stuff

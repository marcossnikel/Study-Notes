GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs that was developed by Facebook in 2012. It provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST (Representational State Transfer) API.

## Core Concepts

GraphQL has several core concepts that are important to understand in order to use it effectively:

### Schema

The schema is the central concept of GraphQL. It describes the capabilities of the API and defines the data types, queries, and mutations that can be performed. The schema is written in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL).

### Queries

Queries are the way that clients ask for data in GraphQL. A query is a request for specific data and follows a specific syntax. A query is always structured to mirror the shape of the data that the client expects to receive.

### Mutations

Mutations are similar to queries, but are used to modify data on the server. A mutation is a request to perform an action, such as creating, updating, or deleting data.

### Resolvers

Resolvers are functions that are responsible for fetching the data that is requested in a query or mutation. They take in the arguments of the query or mutation and return the requested data.

## Advantages of GraphQL

GraphQL provides several advantages over traditional REST APIs:

-   Increased efficiency: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.
    
-   Flexibility: With GraphQL, clients can ask for multiple resources in a single request, reducing the number of API calls needed.
    
-   Strong typing: The schema defines the data types that can be queried, providing a strong typing system that ensures that the data returned by the API is always valid.
    
-   Evolutionary API development: GraphQL allows the API to evolve over time without breaking client applications. This is achieved by adding new fields to the schema, which can be requested by newer clients but ignored by older clients.
    

## Conclusion

GraphQL is a powerful and flexible data query and manipulation language that offers several advantages over traditional REST APIs. Its core concepts of schema, queries, mutations, and resolvers provide a powerful framework for building APIs that can evolve over time without breaking client applications.

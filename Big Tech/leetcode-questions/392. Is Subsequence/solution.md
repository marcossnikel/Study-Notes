Create two pointers, one for each of the two input strings (the "subsequence" string and the "target" string).

Loop through the "target" string using the first pointer.
a. If the current character in the "target" string matches the current character in the "subsequence" string, advance the second pointer.
b. Repeat step 2a until the end of the "subsequence" string is reached or a mismatch is encountered.

Return a boolean indicating whether the "subsequence" string was found to be a subsequence of the "target" string.

Note: The goal of this problem is to determine if one string is a subsequence of another string. The two pointers allow for a linear-time solution by only iterating through the "target" string once and checking if the characters in the "subsequence" string appear in order. If a mismatch is encountered, the iteration can continue in the "target" string without having to start over in the "subsequence" string.

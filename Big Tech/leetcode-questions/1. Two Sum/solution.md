Create an empty dictionary (hash table) to store the elements of the array as keys and their indices as values.

Loop through the array, and for each element:
a. Calculate the target value (target = target - current element).
b. Check if the target value exists in the dictionary.
c. If the target value exists in the dictionary, return a tuple of the indices of the current element and the target value.

If no solution is found, return an empty array or some indication of failure.

Note: The goal of this problem is to find two elements in an array whose sum is equal to a target value, and to return their indices in the array. The hash table allows for an efficient lookup of the target value, with a time complexity of O(1) on average.
